# Open Beta Curated Datasets

## Motivation
This directory contains datasets collected and curated from the raw Open Beta data, the idea being to provide data in a rapidly useable format for data science projects.

## Current Status
The datasets can be downloaded as compressed (zip) pickles of Pandas data frames.
* Curated_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip is a dataset containing only technical rock climbs, with simplified types and reformatted grades. Please see the OpenBetaData_Curation Jupyter notebook for more information on how this set was built.
* CuratedWithRatings_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip contains the same data as the previous point but is merged with all the available user rating data.
* All_Ratings.pkl.zip contains all the user rating data concatenated into one file.
